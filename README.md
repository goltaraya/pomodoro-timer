# Pomodoro Pineapple Timer 🍍
## What is a Pomodoro Timer?
Pomodoro Timer is a methodology designed for students and workers for helping them to administrate their time better. <br>
Basically, all you got to do is to set a N-minute round for studying or working and after that round, you take some 5-15 min break. <br>
After that, you repeat this process as much as you want/can
<br><br>
## How Pomodoro Pineapple Timer is set?
The timer is setup with 4 rounds (25 min - 5 min) <br>
After each 25-min round, you get a checkmark and 5 minutes break (✅)! <br>
And after the 4th round, you get a 20-min break with all 4 checkmarks (✅✅✅✅)! <br>
I hope it helps you with your business 🥳 <br>
